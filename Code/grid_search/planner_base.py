# This class implements the basic components of the forward search
# planning algorithm in LaValle's book and the lecture slides. The
# same general framework can be used to implement a wide array of
# algorithms, including depth first search, breadth first search,
# greedy (shortest distance first) search, Dijkstra and A*. The code
# here is written to be easy to understand and is not optimised in any
# way.

# The code includes a number of hooks which do not appear in LaValle's
# description, but are useful when implementing some techniques. In
# addition, the code can optionally use a graphics library to draw the
# grid cells.

# The planner itself takes an occupancy map as an input. This
# specifies the structure of the environment - basically how big is
# it, which cells are blocked and which cells are open. The planner
# internally constructs a SearchGrid. This contains the nodes and
# edges from the planner and the labels associated with them.
